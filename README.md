# K-Means-Clustering

The k-Means Clustering algorithm is one of the simplest and most popular algorithms used in data mining, especially in unsupervised learning.
Usually, in multi-feature mode, different properties of objects must be used to cluster them. In this way, we deal with multidimensional data. Some properties of objects may be quantitative and some qualitative. However, what is important is a way to measure the degree of similarity or dissimilarity between objects that should be considered in clustering methods.

In K-Means Clustering, optimization of an objective function is used. The clustering responses in this method may be performed with the help of minimization or maximization of the objective function. This means that if the criterion is distance measure between objects, the objective function will be based on minimization. The answer to the clustering operation is to find clusters where the distance between objects in each cluster is minimal. In contrast, if the dissimilarity function is used to measure the similarity of objects, the target function is selected so that the clustering response maximizes its value in each cluster.
